Shaders tell the GPU how and why are we going to process the data
Vertex Array is the actual data: 
		Vertex Buffer(includes the vertex data, including position of each vertice, texture coordenates, vertex colors, normals) and 
		Index Buffer( contains the indices into the vertex buffer so we know what to render, so we can choose which vertices we want to render)
